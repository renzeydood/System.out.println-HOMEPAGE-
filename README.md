# System.out.println-HOMEPAGE-
My GitHub Homepage. =) Because even my GitHub account needed to be Marie Kondo'd

## Introduction
Firstly, if you've somehow got here, I'd like to say thanks! =) There's more to say but I'll update when I'm free. (Still a student. LOL.)

## Repository Indexing
Just a way for me to organize my repositories
 - TP_YXSX_: These are notable projects when I was a student in Temasek Polytechnic (TP)
 - NTU_YXSX_: These are the notable projects I've done as an undergraduate student in Nanyang Technological University (NTU)
 - Learning_: These are just various notable learning materials I've gathered
 - Projects_: Notable projects that I've done so far, and more to come!
